# Predict House Price
## Introduction
I designed a program for landlords as a final project in this course. The program can provide recommended price of the new room for the landlord by the conditions of facilities, area, and so on. First, I used web-clawer to collect details of each room on the vacation rental website HomeAway, and made some pre-processing on the data. Then, I put the data into different models to evaluate the price. However, the accuracy of my program is only 70%, because the information collected from HomeAway doesnâ€™t supply detailed classification (such as downtown or suburb). Even so, through the final project, I had deeper understanding about the theory and the application of machine learning, and that is my greatest harvest.

## Preprocessing
1. Web-Crawler (HomeAway)
